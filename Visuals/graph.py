# TODO: Using matplotlib to generate graphs for research purposes
# TODO: Or use the WEKA graphs; I haven't figured out which yet
# REMEMBER: Only include important graphs. This means DON'T include graphs for every single attribute and instance
# I need to use WEKA visualizations to search for important patterns and data (those are the only figures I might include)
# I'll NEED TO MENTION that in order to view graphs, std deviation, mean, and other data, the data should be loaded in WEKA GUI
import matplotlib
