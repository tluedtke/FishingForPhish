Ready to go fishing for phish? (TODO)
===================================

**FishingForPhish** is a Python library that I haven't started the documentation for for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
